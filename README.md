# TDI_MILESTONE_PROJECT

In this project, I created a python application to explore stock pricing within the last 30 working days. This is to satisfy the prerequisite for joining TDI (The Data Incubator) program.

In the future, I would like to add prediction methods (using ML techniques), and explore the statistics parameters of the assigned stocks.

I created a session for plotting and hopefully I will add prediction sessions in the near future.
